# Exercise 3:

# Write a shell script that that allows a user to select an action from the menu. 
# The actions are to show the disk usage, show the uptime on the system, and show the users that are logged into the system. 
# Tell the user to enter q to quit. 
# Display "Goodbye!" just before the script exits.

# If the user enters anything other than 1,2,3,or q,tell them that it is an "Invalid option."

# You can show the disk usage by using the df command. 
# To show the uptime, use the uptime command. 
# To show the users logged into the system, use the who command. 
# Print a blank line after the output of each command.

# Example output:

# 1. Show disk usage.
# 2. Show system uptime.
# 3. Show the users logged into the system.
# What would you like to do? (Enter q to quit.) 2
# 14:59:08up3days, 7:36, 7users, loadaverage:0.13,0.22,0.33
# 1. Show disk usage.
# 2. Show system uptime.
# 3. Show the users logged into the system.
